## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a great challenge to learn more about JS and CSS. I managed to use flexbox in both mobile and desktop view, instead of flexbox for mobile and grid for desktop. I used 'order' property to move an element to end of the flexbox.

The JS part is also a good practice for form validation and dom manipulation.
